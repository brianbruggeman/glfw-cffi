Getting Started
===============

GLFW-CFFI dynamically builds a pythonic interface to GLFW using the
GLFW.h file provided with GLFW3.x.  As a consequence, everything within
the module is almost entirely dynamic and can be found within the
`__init__.py` file at the top of the package.

Generally helpful, the examples folder will contain ways of using
glfw-cffi.  This is by no means exhaustive, but the few examples
provided should give a great way to get started.


Installation
------------


Using Pip
~~~~~~~~~

GLFW-CFFI should be installed using pip:

    ``pip install glfw-cffi``
